## Description

Each time a developer creates and deploys an application for the world to use, it is best practice for them to also write a README.md file for the application. Given that writing a README.md is a large part of the development process that needs to be done often, why not use an application to streamline it?

This Node.js application does just that! Say goodbye to having to remember everything to include within the application's documentation, and say hello to a quick Q&A process that automatically generates a professional README.md for you!

Developers are constantly looking for ways to streamline their efficiency during development, and writing your application's documentation should be apart of that! From badges to display pertinent information, to sections that organize topics within the documentation, this Professional README.md Generator is here to help you as you develop your next greatest creation!

### User Story

```md
As a developer

I want a README generator

So that I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```md
Given a command-line application that accepts user input

When I am prompted for information about my application repository

Then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and the sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions

When I enter my project title

Then this is displayed as the title of the README

When I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions

Then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests

When I choose a license for my application from a list of options

Then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under

When I enter my GitHub username

Then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile

When I enter my email address

Then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions

When I click on the links in the Table of Contents

Then I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
```

## Installation

To use this application, please fork the repository and clone the new repository in your code editor. This application requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), so please make sure to have it installed. Within your new repository folder, open the integrated terminal and type in the command `npm install` to install the Inquirer.js Node Package Manager dependency. 

Now that all of the required tools have been installed, type this command into the integrated terminal to begin the prompts: `node index.js`. Once you have finished answering the questions about the application that a README.md file is being created for, a new file will appear in the directory called `README.md`! Right-click on the file and select `Open Preview` to preview the file's rendering on websites, such as GitHub.
